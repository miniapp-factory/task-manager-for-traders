Task Manager for Traders — App Description

Create a simple mini app called “Task Manager for Traders”.
The app helps crypto traders organize their daily tasks by manually adding, marking, and removing items.
No internet access or external integrations are required.

Core Features
 1. A text input field where the user can type a task (e.g., “Review charts”, “Check portfolio”, “Set alerts”).
 2. A dropdown menu to set a priority level:
 • High
 • Medium
 • Low
 3. A button “Add Task” that saves the task to a visible list.
 4. A task list showing:
 • Task name
 • Priority level
 • Status (Pending / Completed)
 5. Each task should include:
 • A “Mark as Completed” button that changes its status
 • An “Edit Task” button to modify the text or priority
 • A “Delete” button to remove the task

How the App Should Work
 • User enters a task and selects a priority.
 • Presses “Add Task”, and the task appears in the list.
 • User can update the task text or its priority via the edit button.
 • User can mark a task as completed with one click.
 • User can delete tasks at any time.
 • All data is stored locally within the app session.

UI Requirements
 • Inputs at the top for quick task creation.
 • Task list displayed below in a clean table or card layout.
 • Completed tasks should show a simple visual indicator (e.g., “Completed” label).
 • No external data, no API calls, no Web3 interactions.

Goal of the App

Provide traders with a clean, minimal tool to manage their daily activities and stay organized without relying on external data sources.

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create a new file that describes the logo image to be generated.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it. Once that file is added, I’ll also give you the block to create the new `logo.png.todo` file.
