+Task Manager for Traders — App Description
+
+Create a simple mini app called “Task Manager for Traders”.
+The app helps crypto traders organize their daily tasks by manually adding, marking, and removing items.
+No internet access or external integrations are required.
+
+Core Features
+ 1. A text input field where the user can type a task (e.g., “Review charts”, “Check portfolio”, “Set alerts”).
+ 2. A dropdown menu to set a priority level:
+ • High
+ • Medium
+ • Low
+ 3. A button “Add Task” that saves the task to a visible list.
+ 4. A task list showing:
+ • Task name
+ • Priority level
+ • Status (Pending / Completed)
+ 5. Each task should include:
+ • A “Mark as Completed” button that changes its status
+ • An “Edit Task” button to modify the text or priority
+ • A “Delete” button to remove the task
+
+How the App Should Work
+ • User enters a task and selects a priority.
+ • Presses “Add Task”, and the task appears in the list.
+ • User can update the task text or its priority via the edit button.
+ • User can mark a task as completed with one click.
+ • User can delete tasks at any time.
+ • All data is stored locally within the app session.
+
+UI Requirements
+ • Inputs at the top for quick task creation.
+ • Task list displayed below in a clean table or card layout.
+ • Completed tasks should show a simple visual indicator (e.g., “Completed” label).
+ • No external data, no API calls, no Web3 interactions.
+
+Goal of the App
+
+Provide traders with a clean, minimal tool to manage their daily activities and stay organized without relying on external data sources.
